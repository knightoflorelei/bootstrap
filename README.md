# bootstrap.sh
A shell script to setup a minimal configuration tailored to my needs after doing a fresh system reinstall. This will be a Fedora-centric script since it became my distribution of choice after letting go of Arch-based systems thanks to the high maintenance necessary to keep them going.

The purpose of this documentation is to help me retrace, refactor and debug the script as need be.
